divide
parse
head
reciprocal

Are those throwing exceptions
What exceptions they are throwing
How to collect all exceptions

Show railway approach
Introduce left and right, types and constructors
Create head and show type propagation
Impl fold show rails gluing (head result)
Impl map show right rail transform (shout)
Impl flat show both rails gluing (parse)
Impl exhaust errors check (add str constants to errors)
Impl list traversal. Show container swapping (head <- parse and parse)

Additional:
Migrate error throw code (fromThrowable)
Demonstrate traversal technic on records
