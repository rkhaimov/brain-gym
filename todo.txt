add strict types for multimethod
implement mixins?

oop
    evaluate
    adding BinaryMultiply is easy
    adding print is hard

func
    adding print is easy
    adding BinaryMultiply is hard

visitor is the same as func

func
    why not overriding
        compile time
        should be close together
        several lang can use it
    single dispatch
    invoke evaluate example

absfact
    IExpFactory
    makeTwoPlusThree
    EvaluatorFactory
    IExpWithConditionFactory
    makeTwoPlusThreeOrZero
    ConditionPrintFactory
    What if separate module
    Composition
